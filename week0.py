# week 0 problem 1
# create a function that returns a list of (vitamins,injections) tuples for each attribute that they need.
# Complete problem statement in README.mds


# your input type should be a list,
# output should also be a list containing tuples
# Example:
# input: [250, 0, 250, 0, 0, 0]
# expected output: [(25,0),(0,0),(25,0),(0,0),(0,0),(0,0)]
# input: [500, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#expected output: "No medicine given"
# HINT: using % operator to find remainder may be helpful
def dose(needs):
    #YOUR SOLUTION STARTS HERE



list1= ['HP', 'Attack', 'Defense', 'Special Attack', 'Special Defense', 'Speed']

if sum(needs) >=500:
   print ('No medicine given')
    
for needs in list1[0:6]:
if list1.values[0:6] >=250:
   print ('No medicine given')

else needs%10 
    for needs in list1[0:6]:
    l== [vitamin, injections]
    if needs%10 = 0
    vitamin = needs//10
    else injections = needs%10
print(l)



print(lst1.values[0:6]) # starts from index 0, ends at position 4-1 = index 3. 

def test_ex2(case, expected):
	assert dose(case) == expected
